[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/poldham/oldhammisc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/poldham/oldhammisc)

This is a small personal package of obscure miscellaneous functions. I am also teaching myself how to write an r-package and test it with Travis in the hope that one day I'll be better at programming in R. In the meantime...  

The functions in the package mainly use plyr, dplyr, tidyr and stringr and provide small wrappers to get to data.frames from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/packages/) packages such as [rcrossref](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref) and [rorcid](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid). I'll add some more if and when my brain starts working again. 

Thanks to [Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Beginners-Guide-to-Travis/) for the incredibly useful [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Travis-CI for R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/a-beginners-guide-to-travis-ci-for-r/). If you stumble across this page take while lost on the internet take a look at Julia's [text mining related packages](https://github.com/juliasilge).
